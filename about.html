      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Jacob Hoover. This next year will be my final year of
        college for my bachelor's. I grew up in a very small town and have
        always had a passion for coding or anything computer-related. I
        graduated in 2019 and started college again in 2024. In the interm I
        joined the military and have been serving for 5 years now. I live in the
        town I grew up in with my wife and our 2 dogs. HTML is what first drew
        me into coding back in high school, but nowadays I enjoy working with
        Java more. My hobbies include gaming, reading, golfing, and working out.
        If I am doing none of those things I am probably spending time with my
        family.
